    <h1 class="BeautyOfArt">The Beauty Of Art</h1>
<h2>What Does Beauty in Art Mean?</h2>
<p>Beauty resides in what is being observed and is defined by the characteristics of the art object, such as symmetry, order, balance, and proportion.
 Art is a means to state an opinion or feeling, creating a different view of the world, whether inspired by other artists' work or something entirely new. Beauty is whatever aspect of that or anything else that makes an individual feel positive. However, art does not necessarily need to be positive. It can be hurtful or displeasing, making you think or consider things you would not want to. But if it evokes emotion, then it can be considered art.

<div class="Painters">
    <div class="Monet">
    <h2 id="Oscar-Claude Monet">Oscar-Claude Monet</h2>
<p>French painter and founder of the impressionist painting who is seen as a key figure in the modernist movement, 
    especially in his attempts to paint nature as he sees it. Monet’s painting that got him his fame is the Camille or The Woman in the Green Dress (La Femme à la Robe Verte), 
    painted in 1866. It was one of many works featuring his wife, Camille Doncieux, as the model. The painting was done in four days and received positive reviews from critics, 
    described as, “the Parisian queen, the triumphant woman”. Although it’s hard to say what painting got Monet his fame, his artwork is still getting recognized today as it was when they were first painted, beautiful.

    <div class="Kramskoi">
    <h2 id="IvanKram">Ivan Nikolaevich Kramskoi</h2>
<p>Ivan Kramskoi was a Russian painter and art critic. He was an intellectual leader of the art movement known as the Wanderers between 1860 and 1880. 
    Kramskoi has many famous works, but the one I will talk about is the Portrait of an Unknown Woman. Portrait of an Unkown Woman, also known as The Unkown Woman, An Unkown Lady or Stranger, was painted in 1883. 
    The model whose identity is unknown, as said in the name, is seen as a woman of “quiet strength and forthright gaze.” The portrait was painted late in Kramskoi’s life. 
    He had begun his career as a rebel working outside the establishment and was expelled from the Russian Academy early on. Its popularity quickly grew, and its beauty became a popular theme amongst Russian artists. It had been described as “unusually bright, densely painted, and relaxed.”

    <div class="Repin">
    <h2 id="IlyaRep">Ilya Yefimovich Repin</h2>
<p>Ilya Repin was a Ukrainian-born Russian painter. He became one of the most renowned artists in Russia in the 19th century. His major works include Barge Haulers on the Volga, 
    Religious Procession in Kursk Province, Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan; and Reply of the Zaporozhian. One of the paintings that got Ilya Repin his fame is, 
    Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan, which I’ll be talking about today. Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan was painted in 1885. It took Repin two years to finish the painting. Even though the painting is haunting yet beautiful, it holds a lot of controversy. 
    The painting depicts Russia’s first and founding czar moments after murdering his son. It’s not only been the subject of criticism, but iconoclasm. In 1913, the painting had been slashed by a mentally ill iconographer. Though motives were unclear, 
    Repin blamed the attack on the growing influence of modern art movements, who felt the followers “had no respect for old art.” The painting had been attacked again in 2018, this time by a metal pole. The unmanned man said he became “overwhelmed by something” after drinking vodka inside the museum cafeteria. 
    Whether it may be a drunken mistake or a malicious thing, it will always be a subject of criticism. Some people believe that the “overwhelming feeling” might be because it was inaccurate and part of an old-age smear campaign to make the czar appear more bloodthirsty than he was. While there is no evidence to support the thought that Ivan was an exceptionally bloodthirsty ruler, 
    there are a lot of conflicting accounts of how his son died. A statesman, who worked under the czar wrote in his diary of the murder, the tsarevich was beaten to death by his father after attempting to prevent the latter from “committing an ugly act.”
