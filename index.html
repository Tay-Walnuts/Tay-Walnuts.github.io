                <h3 class="PLOTS">Plot</h3>
<p>Fujimoto, a once-human wizard, lives underwater with his daughter Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. 
    After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named S≈çsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, S≈çsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, 
    healing the wound almost instantly. S≈çsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving S≈çsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.
</br>
    Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by S≈çsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, 
    Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to S≈çsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. 
    His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising S≈çsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.
</br>
    Gran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. S≈çsuke's father, K≈çichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. 
    Gran Mamare reassures him, and declares that if S≈çsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if S≈çsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.
</br>
    The next day, S≈çsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make S≈çsuke's pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, 
    seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. S≈çsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. 
    Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and S≈çsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of nature, begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.
</br>
    S≈çsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; 
    S≈çsuke confirms that he does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to S≈çsuke, 
    who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having decided he can trust S≈çsuke. 
    Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses S≈çsuke, completing her transformation as a human.</p>

<p>
    Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents Akio and Y≈´ko are traveling to their new home. Akio decides to take a shortcut and stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Akio insists on exploring despite his daughter's protests. 
    Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers her parents have turned into pigs, 
    and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.
</br>
    Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a y≈çkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji refuses and asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries frightening Chihiro away, 
    but Chihiro persists and is eventually given a working contract. As Chihiro signs the contract with her name (ÂçÉÂ∞ã), Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name, renaming her Sen (ÂçÉ). She soon realizes she can no longer remember her real name, and Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; 
    if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.
</br> 
    Sen is frequently mocked by the other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face (È°îÁÑ°„Åó, Kaonashi) inside, believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen‚Äôs first customer. 
    After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers.
</br> 
    Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, 
    Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up the seal and a slug,
    which Sen crushes with her foot.
</br> 
    Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders Sen's parents be slaughtered, 
    but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.
</br>
    Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the slug to take control of Haku. Using his dragon form, Haku offers to fly them home. No-Face decides to stay behind with Zeniba and become her spinner, while Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River 
    years ago and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River („Éã„ÇÆ„Éè„É§„Éü „Ç≥„Éè„ÇØ„Éå„Ç∑, Nigihayami Kohakunushi). When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents among a group of pigs to leave. After she answers correctly none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. 
    Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, unable to remember anything after eating at the restaurant. Shortly before leaving for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, her hairband from Zeniba still intact.</p>

        <div class="TOTOro">
            
<p>In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, 
    that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The susuwatari leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as "Totoro". Mei thinks Totoro is 
    the troll from her illustrated book Three Billy Goats Gruff. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.
</br>
    The girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. 
    A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, 
    the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.
</br> 
    The girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. 
    Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital,
    where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.
</br>
    Eventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.</p>

        <h3 class="MEANING">Meaning of My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p class="MeanToto">Whether elements in My Neighbor Totoro are imagined or real, the film explores family dynamics 
    in a way that may be relatable to a number of individuals. Totoro and friends may serve a purpose 
    in evoking cute aggression in viewers, but the psychology in My Neighbor Totoro is that of coping, imagination, and growth.</p>
