    <h2>Impact Art had On Me</h2>
<p> The impact art had on me I would say is life changing, because I now want to be a tattoo artist. Ever since I was young I've gone to tattoo shops with my mom. 
    I love the smell and feeling when I step into a tattoo shop. It's so satisfying seeing the tattoo come to life, the coloring, shading, composition, everything. I just love watching the process in which people create. 
    I love watching the creative process, drawing, earsing somethig that wasnt up to par with them, and re-drawing it. It's always so interesting to see what they change and why they changed it. </p>
    
    <h2>My Art Experince</h2>
<p>I do multiple mediums. I do digital, paper, paint, grpahite, and more. I don't know when I first started drawing, but my love for art started in 3rd grade. And what got me into art, even though it is embarassing for me to admit, animation memes. They were, still are, so cool to watch, especially with different interpretations of the song or just seeing people's original characters. And what got me into character art is an app called Gacha, I sadly can't find the first one but looking back at the videos I used to watch make me cringe so hard. But its so helpful to map out what you want (with limitations of course). I mean I still use it sometimes if I need help with character design. </p>

<p>(I was going to put a compilation but it only had some I actually watched, and most of it was cringe.)</p>
