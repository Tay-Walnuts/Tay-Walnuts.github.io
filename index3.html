<p>Kimo_ink or Moonkee Hwang is a custom-made 3D tattoo artist based in Seoul Korea. Hwang turns 3D art into tattoos, whether that be in color or black in white, and they turn out amazing. 
    It looks like you’re looking at a 3D image and not a tattoo. I admire him so much because his work looks so effortless and smooth. His line work is so smooth, his shading looks so soft yet harsh. 
    He is an amazing tattoo artist and I aspire to be like that one day. </p>

<p>Lilredbeany is such a cool person to me, they make a comic called The School Bus Graveyard, a thriller almost sci-fi story I would say. 
    I love this simplistic yet detailed style, they know how to convey emotion, and their understanding of human anatomy is inspiring. It’s interesting to see all of her character designs and their personalities, whether that be drawn or written out, 
    it’s interesting to see how all of the characters interact with each other as well. It’s also nice to see Red draw the characters out of the story, showing how they interact with each other without it being in the comic. I think Red has amazing storytelling skills with their drawing and writing. 
    I would like to get to that level one day, of understanding how the human body works, as well as how to convey emotions with a drawing.

<p>Shelbyclark, or Shelby, is a sculptor who focuses on sculpting foxes, sculpting various things as well. I love her work, she knows how to compose her sculptures. 
    She does beautiful color work as well, I love the muted yet bright colors. I also like how stylistic her work is, her sculptures are not just foxes, they are almost like something you would hear in a fairy tale, 
    the foxes have a mermaid tail. She does fox headshots as well. They are beautiful, and they have a theme because they are not just a fox head it's a work of art. She also uses a hard medium, she uses air dry clay instead of clay that needs to be fired. 
    And air dry clay is prone to cracking and not drying properly. She is a wonderful artist that I hope to live up to one day.

<p>Catrex0_0 is a digital artist who, like Red, has a simplistic yet detailed style. I like the muted colors, with a bright color either illuminating the character(s) or the background. 
    I also really enjoy the style of her art, the line art is very soft yet harsh at the same time. She also really knows how to use light in her work, I have a difficult time with using a light source, 
    but seeing it in her work is very inspiring. I love the ideas she has, it’s very interesting looking at all the detail put into her work.
