        <h2 class="About">About Miyazaki</h2>
        <p class="Para">Born in Tokyo City in the Empire of Japan, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early 
            age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between 
            artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March 
            and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, 
            before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) 
            in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978). He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha 
            in 1979 to direct his first feature film The Castle of Cagliostro as well as the television series Sherlock Hound. In the same period, he also began writing and 
            illustrating the manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1982–1994), and he also directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.</p>
